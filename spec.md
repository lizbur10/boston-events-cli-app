# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - typing 'boston_events' launches CLI.rb which allows users to explore events currently going on in the Boston area.
- [x] Pull data from an external source - the event categories and events are pulled from the ArtsBoston calendar, http://calendar.artsboston.org/
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - the CLI first presents a list of categories the user chooses from. Typing in a category number loads a list of current events in the category. Finally, the user can type in the number of an individual event to see details.
